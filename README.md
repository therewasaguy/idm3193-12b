Adding React to an Express scaffold

## Scripts

Watch client-side JS (`src/*`) for changes and compile from JSX / ES6 to a single JavaScript file (`public/javascripts/bundle.js`)
```
webpack -w 
```

Start server on port 3000
```
npm start
```

##### Possible next steps
- Create a development script that does all of the above, and compiles SCSS --> CSS
